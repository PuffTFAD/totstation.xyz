								<h3>Who we are.</h3>
								<p>Over a millennia ago, a blind minstrel recieved a vision of a dark future. One where the hubris of man had succeeded in being its own downfall.  Frantic and desperate, he tried to make anyone who could hear him understand that we were doomed. Of course, as is the way with these things, he was seen as a loon and largely ignored. Those that listened only did so for the passing enjoyment of the crackpot show. Through a series of events (some fortunate, other less so) The Minstrel found his way to the court of the great wizard Merlin. There, The Minstrel revealed all the horrid and troubling visions that had plagued him. After listening and carefully considering all that he had been told, the great wisdom of Merlin led him to the conclusion that this man was neither insane nor a liar. However, there was a problem. How can you solve a problem so far into the future? To that end the <b>TEAM OF TEAMS</b> was formed.</p>
								<p>More recently, our ancient order has finally spread it's wings and incorporated the internet into our good fight. We started subtly on a program called VRChat, inducting members at an astounding rate. We then decided we needed some way to contact our various agents throughout the world. We discovered that Discord was the main form of communication for the generation and set out to make the best discord server out there. We've mostly succeeded in our lofty plans, but we still require more members willing to fight the good fight. That's where you come in.</p>
								<h3>I'm ready, where do I go?</h3>
								<p>We have many secret projects going at the moment. Here are a few in active development.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The website you are currently reading: Being our first foray into the 'net, our website might seem a bit basic. That's because it is.</li>
									<li>Space Station 13: Our training SIM for the harsh reality of space and living in it is fully operational, but we need mods and a steady userbase. That could be you?</li>
									<li>12 games in 12 months: We're taking an idea seen on a Yahtzee video and making it a reality. More to come on that later.</li>
									<li>Social: Having to constantly save humanity from itself really makes it hard to keep an active social life. If you'd like to run the reddit/twitter/facebook for us we'd love that!</li>
									<li>There's probably something I'm forgetting, so I'll leave this here for now.</li>
